- The project uses `uv` for package and Python version management
- Always use your task planner or TODO list tools to track your work
- Always add tests - general unit tests for new behavior, and (only when relevant) integration-like tests at the controller level for different scenarios.
- Ensure tests are located in a file corresponding to the file under tests - for example, app/controllers/a_controller.py would be tested by tests/controllers/test_a_controller.py.
- When you're done, run `uv run pytest` to ensure tests pass
- Finally, run `ruff format` and ensure both `ruff` and `mypy` are green
- For UI changes: run `cd ui && pnpm run format && pnpm run lint && pnpm run tsc` (or use pre-commit hooks)
- You don't really need to write documentation, excessive UPDATE/ABOUT files, etc. When relevant you can update the READMEs a bit but that should be done sparingly. Never create a new .md file without being asked.
